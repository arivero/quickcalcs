  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Effective date: 2025-10-25</p>

  <p>This website is a static documentation and demo site for QuickCalcs, served from GitHub Pages at <a href="https://arivero.github.io/quickcalcs/">arivero.github.io/quickcalcs</a>. We keep data collection to the minimum necessary.</p>

  <h2>Data Controller</h2>
  <p>The site is maintained by the owner of the GitHub account <a href="https://github.com/arivero">@arivero</a>. For privacy inquiries, please contact via the GitHub repository issues or by email at <a href="mailto:al.rivero@gmail.com">al.rivero@gmail.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>What we collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No personal accounts, sign‑ins, or forms.</li>
    <li>No analytics, advertising, or tracking pixels.</li>
    <li>No cookies are set by this site.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This site includes a lightweight service worker for offline caching of assets; it stores only copies of static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images) on your device to improve performance. It does not collect or transmit personal data.</p>

  <h2>Hosting and logs</h2>
  <p>The site is hosted by GitHub Pages and delivered over HTTPS (TLS). As with most web hosting, GitHub may process standard server logs (e.g., IP address and user‑agent) to operate and secure the service. Such processing is covered by the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement">GitHub Privacy Statement</a>.</p>

  <h2>Legal basis</h2>
  <p>We do not actively process personal data. If you contact us (for example, via email or GitHub issues), we will process the information you provide for the purpose of responding to you. The legal basis is our legitimate interest in operating and improving the project and responding to inquiries.</p>

  <h2>Data retention</h2>
  <p>We do not retain personal data via this site. If you contact us directly, we retain your message only as long as necessary to address your inquiry unless a longer period is required by law.</p>

  <h2>International transfers</h2>
  <p>GitHub (as the hosting provider) may process data on servers outside the EU/EEA. See the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement">GitHub Privacy Statement</a> for details on safeguards.</p>

  <h2>Your rights (EU/EEA)</h2>
  <p>If applicable under the GDPR, you have rights to access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, and to object to processing. To exercise these rights, contact the Data Controller via the channels above. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>The site is served over HTTPS via GitHub Pages. While we do not collect personal data through the site, we take reasonable measures consistent with a static site to keep content delivery secure.</p>

  <h2>Third‑party links</h2>
  <p>Pages may link to third‑party sites (e.g., GitHub, Twitter, Forem). Visiting those sites is subject to their own privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Material changes will be reflected by updating the effective date on this page.</p>
